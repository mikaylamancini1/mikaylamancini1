My name is Mikayla Mancini and I am a senior in SEAS studying computer science on the applications track at Columbia. I also am pursuing a second major in Financial Economics and after graduation I will be working for Credit Suisse. 

I like working primarily in python but also know Java, C, SQL, Javascript, and HTML/CSS pretty well.

Beyond school and work I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I love dogs and animals and also play golf and tennis. Lastly, I like watching sports with my favorite teams being the NY Giatnts, Boston Red Sox, Boston Celtics, and NY Rangers.
